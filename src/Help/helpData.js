This checkbox allows to indicate that parallel planning is allowed on this PL . By selecting the option, employees can now seamlessly take and track multiple PL's concurrently. This enhancement aims to provide a more flexible and efficient workflow, especially in departments where the need for simultaneous planning efforts is prevalent.",

This new guideline ensures optimal mentorship and support for each trainee, fostering a more personalized and impactful learning experience. Coaches and assessors are now advised that the maximum trainee capacity per mentor during PL sessions is the number you put here. This measure has been implemented to maintain the quality and effectiveness of the training process, guaranteeing that each trainee receives the attention and guidance necessary to excel in their practical learning endeavors. We appreciate your cooperation in adhering to this guideline as we strive to enhance the overall training experience for both mentors and trainees alike.",
